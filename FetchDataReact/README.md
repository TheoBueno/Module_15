#  Title of the Repository: D&D Fetch

## Description of Repository:

  This Repo consists of the Module 15 exercises, the second part of which involves
creating a website that deals with API calls.
 
## How to Use: Exercise 2 - My Database for D&D Search:
  One can type your on the search field for a specific characteristic they are searching
for to filter the classes, and page through them by clicking the buttons. Also, the logo
to the left of the selected class name will take you to the official WotC D&D Beyond link
for that exact class. 

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  Implement a useReducer and figure out a way to convert the subtitles and buletpoints
of string into bold text. The string has '#' and '*' on the long descriptions like in a 
.md file.
