#  Title of the Repository: Module_15

## Description of Repository:

  This Repo consists of the Module 15 exercises, the first part of which involves
creating a functional 'ATM' Simulation.
 
## How to Use - ATM List:
  When the need for a deposit arises, first select deposit from the dropdown menu,
then click or type in the value of your deposit, followed by the submit button.
  Should you need a withdraw, also nicknamed 'Cash Back' in this instance, change
the mode to that and proceed similarly. Should you attempt to imput a value beyond
the means of your dummy account, the submit button will turn grey. 
  For user convenience, I altered the code to allow for multiple transactions in a 
row without the need to change the value - a characteristic from the original code
- but should you try to use this to withdraw repeated times that would lead to a 
overdraft, an alert pops up to inform you of a lack of funds.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  I would possibly change this project by creating a user interface with more to it,
color and images, possibly a dummy ATM visual for a retro look - pixelated videogame
style - or possibly add a "program transaction" to allow for a planned payment at a 
specific time or date.
